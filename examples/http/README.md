# HTTP Serve Example

Run:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/axom -- serve examples/http/serve-minimal.axom --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

Then verify the built-in health endpoint:

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

Expected body:

```
ok
```

Current `serve` behavior is a bootstrap slice (M13): the HTTP endpoint is runtime-provided (`/health`) and is not yet derived from Axom source files.
