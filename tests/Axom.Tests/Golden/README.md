# Golden Files

This folder stores expected codegen outputs for golden tests.

## Naming
- `<TestName>.axom` input lives alongside the test or inline in test code.
- `<TestName>.golden.cs` stores the expected generated C# output.

## Conventions
- Keep files deterministic and minimal.
- Use Unix line endings and 4-space indentation.
