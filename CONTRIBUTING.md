# Contributing to Lume

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lume! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Problems

If you encounter a bug, have a question, or want to suggest an improvement:

1. Check if the problem has already been reported or discussed
2. Create a clear, descriptive report with:
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, .NET version, etc.)

### Proposing Changes

1. **Discuss significant changes first** — For major features or design changes, it's helpful to discuss your ideas before implementing them
2. **Keep changes focused** — Each change should address a single concern
3. **Follow the project's style** — Maintain consistency with existing code and documentation
4. **Write clear commit messages** — Use imperative mood and be descriptive

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious behavior
- Keep functions focused and small where possible

### Commit Messages

Write commit messages in English using imperative mood:

- Good: `Add error propagation operator support`
- Good: `Fix type inference for nested generics`
- Avoid: `Added error propagation` (past tense)
- Avoid: `fixes bug` (too vague)

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your changes work and don't break existing functionality
2. Update documentation if your changes affect user-facing behavior
3. Keep pull requests focused and reasonably sized
4. Provide a clear description of what the PR does and why

## Getting Started

The project is currently in early design phase. The language specification is being developed in [`docs/spec.md`](docs/spec.md). As implementation begins, this guide will be updated with build instructions and development setup.
